# What is bridging? 

Bridging involves transferring transactions from a Layer 1 blockchain (like Ethereum Mainnet) to a Layer 2 blockchain (such as OP Mainnet). This process includes two main types of operations: deposits and withdrawals.

- **Deposits:**
When you transfer tokens from Layer 1 to Layer 2, it's called a deposit. Deposits are generally processed quickly—typically in under 10 minutes—and do not require any additional steps to finalize on Layer 2.

- **Withdrawals:**
Conversely, when you move tokens from Layer 2 back to Layer 1, this is known as a withdrawal. Withdrawals usually involve a mandatory [7-day waiting period](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/blob/main/specs/protocol/withdrawals.md) for fraud prevention and may require one or two additional transactions on the base chain to complete.

- **Fast Withdrawals:**
The fast withdrawal mechanism offers a quicker alternative to the standard 7-day waiting period associated with withdrawing tokens from a Layer 2 to a Layer 1 blockchain. This expedited process, typically completing in about 10-15 minutes, involves leveraging a third party that provides the necessary liquidity.
